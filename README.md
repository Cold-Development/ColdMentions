# üßä ColdMentions - Minecraft Plugin

**ColdMentions** is a Minecraft plugin designed to enhance player interactions by allowing players to mention each other with customizable messages, sounds, and visual notifications. The plugin allows players to mention other players in chat using `@name` or `@everyone`, triggering sound notifications, ActionBar messages, and titles on screen.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Mentions in Chat:**  
   - When a player is mentioned in chat (e.g., `@username`), a sound plays, and a message appears in their ActionBar and/or as a title on the screen.
   - Admins can bypass ignore settings and mention everyone using `@everyone`.

2. **ActionBar Notifications:**  
   - Mentions trigger a customizable message in the ActionBar.
   - Separate messages for regular players, admins, and mentions for `@everyone`.
   - Hex color support for all messages.
   
3. **Title Notifications:**  
   - Displays customizable titles and subtitles on the screen when a player is mentioned.
   - Supports Hex colors and placeholders using PlaceholderAPI.
   
4. **Sound Alerts:**  
   - Configurable sounds for when a player is mentioned.
   - Different sounds for regular player mentions and admin mentions.
   - Volume control for each sound category.

5. **Cooldown for Mentions:**  
   - Prevents spam by enforcing a cooldown between mentions.
   - Admins can bypass this cooldown with permission.

6. **Ignore Feature:**  
   - Players can ignore mentions from other players using the `/cm ignore <player>` command.
   - Admins can bypass ignore settings.
   - **Ignore information is saved into SQLite database**.
   
7. **Update Notifications:**  
   - Notifies admins about available plugin updates on login.
